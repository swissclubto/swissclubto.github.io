If after Sunday's Raclette de l'Amicale Romande you still feel like more
raclette, we have good news! The Swiss Canadian Chamber of commerce hosts an
event on Thursday, September 14, featuring more raclette. This time, served by
a robot!

The event features presentations about the legal implications of artificial
intelligence, and the [Roboclette] inventors talk about their machine.

Shortly after the event, the Swiss film *Dieu est une femme* is shown at TIFF,
and attendees are encouraged to combine the two events. (See all the Swiss
films in our [recent TIFF post][tiff].)

For details and for registration, see the [event page of the SCCC][event].
