We (or, more precisely, Auggie, our treasurer) have overhauled our banking
infrastructure, and are happy to report that we're now able to receive
[e-Transfers]!

Our email address is {% include email.html addr="finance@swissclubtoronto.ca"
%}; auto-deposit is enabled, so no need to provide a security question and
answer.

This is not only convenient, but also saves us a little bit of money compared
to credit card payments, where the payment processor collects a fee.

The membership registration pages on the website and the renewal emails will
reflect this new option soon.
