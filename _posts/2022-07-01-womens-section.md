Our Kaffeeklatsches are the first Wednesday of the month at the new location,
Queen’s Pasta Cafe, 2263 Bloor Street West, at 1.30 pm, and each last Wednesday
of the month at the Pickle Barrel, 5941 Leslie Street (north of Finch).

Please mark these dates in your calendar. Still hoping for changes with this
virus, stay safe and optimistic.
