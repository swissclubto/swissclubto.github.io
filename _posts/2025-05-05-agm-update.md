On April 23, the Annual General Meeting took place for the second time at the
Parkview Manor location. About 65 guests and members were present; the official
Switzerland was represented by Philipp Haesler, Deputy Head of Mission at the
Embassy of Switzerland in Canada, and Alexandra Soriano, Honorary Consul of
Switzerland in Toronto.

Here are the most important updates:

- Board composition:
  - Philippe Moser was elected as President; he held that position already *ad
    interim*
  - Céline Baracho was elected as Vice President
  - Auggie Werner was re-elected as Treasurer
  - Corinne Jakob is stepping down as Director of Entertainment
  - Benjamin Wuethrich is stepping down as Vice President (but stays on the
    board)
- Membership fees will be adjusted for the first time in over 20 years, with
  adjustments phased in over the next three years
  - Individual memberships now cost $40
  - Family memberships now cost $60
- The by-laws were updated to meet requirements for non-profits in Ontario and
  Canada; changes include an AODA Compliance Policy and Plan, and a Conflict of
  Interest Policy. Together, they pave the road for the club to become a
  registered charity.
