### Synopsis

> A journey through a century of Swiss history, tracing the footsteps of those
> who fought to get out of their kitchens---and of those who tried everything
> to send them back in---until they obtained equality of rights, the reality of
> which sometimes still seems very fragile. From the first suffragette
> demonstrations in the 1920s to the feminist strike of 2019, this film---based
> on exceptionally rich archival material and testimonials from female
> activists---summarizes the history of women in politics in Switzerland in the
> 20th and 21st centuries.
