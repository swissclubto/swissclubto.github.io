Enjoy a nice afternoon at the beautiful Simeon Park (just north of the city)
and try traditional Swiss raclette!

Raclette is a traditional dish of molten cheese over boiled potatoes, eaten
with a pickle and a glass of white wine! We prepare our raclette the
traditional way, by heating a half-wheel of cheese over a charcoal fire special
stove.

The event will happen rain or shine, there is a large sheltered pavilion with
plenty of room.

For more information, call  or email Jean-Marc.
