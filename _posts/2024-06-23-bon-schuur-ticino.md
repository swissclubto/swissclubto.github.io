### Synopsis

> A crazy referendum throws Switzerland into a state of emergency. By the
> acceptance of the initiative “No Bilangue” there should be from now on only
> one national language: French. Many German-speaking Swiss are therefore
> having a crisis. Including fifty-six-year-old Walter Egli, who works for the
> Federal Police and must ensure that the transition to monolingualism is
> carried out properly. Although he hardly speaks any French himself, he is
> sent to Ticino with a French-speaking partner to uncover a Ticino resistance
> group that is fighting the new law by all means necessary.
