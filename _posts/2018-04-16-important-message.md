Dear fellow citizens,

The Consulate General is happy to inform you that the “Swiss Consular Days” in
Toronto will be repeated again this year and will take place, during the week
of November 5<sup>th</sup> 2018. This service allows the Consulate to offer
Swiss citizens the opportunity to renew their passports without making a trip
to Montreal.

If you wish to take advantage of the upcoming “Swiss Consular Days” in Toronto
this autumn, you must apply via either of the following official websites:
[www.schweizerpass.ch][pass1] or [www.passeportsuisse.ch][pass2] and make sure
to mention “**Toronto 2018**” in the Remarks section. **Your application must
be submitted no later than August 30<sup>th</sup>.** Please note that, as the
number of available appointments is limited, priority will be given to holders
of Swiss passports expiring within the next 12 months.

*Important:* If you have neglected to update your current civil status or a
name change with the Consulate General, information which must be confirmed by
the competent authorities in Switzerland, your request for a passport renewal
will regretfully not be considered.

Should you wish to receive further information about our consular services,
please visit our website or send an e-mail to
[mon.vertretung@eda.admin.ch][email].

Yours sincerely,

**Consulate General of Switzerland in Montreal**
