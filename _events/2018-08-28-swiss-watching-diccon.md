### Living in the land of milk and money

An outsider on the inside. For the last eight years, [Diccon Bewes][diccon] has
been exploring Switzerland and writing about the places, the people, the trains
and the chocolate. He’s become the accidental expat expert and in this humorous
but insightful talk he’ll share some of his observations about Swiss life. From
small talk to Sunday walks, he’ll show that there’s more to Switzerland than
banks and skis, and reveal the true meaning of Swissness.

Diccon is a British travel writer and chocolate lover who has lived in Bern for
the past 13 years. His first book, *Swiss Watching*, became a number one
bestseller, and he has since written four more books about Switzerland.

After the talk there will be the chance to buy signed copies of Diccon’s books,
and refreshments will be served.
