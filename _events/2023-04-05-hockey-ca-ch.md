As recently [posted about in the *News* section][news], the 2023 Women's World
Ice Hockey Championship takes place in Brampton next month, starring the Swiss
team. Their first game is against host nation Canada, but that game is
unfortunately sold out; however, our friends from the [Swiss Canadian Chamber
of Commerce][sccc] organize a public viewing, to which the Swiss community is
cordially invited.
