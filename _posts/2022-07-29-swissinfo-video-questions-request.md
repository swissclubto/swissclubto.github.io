Swissinfo is looking for short videos from Swiss abroad:

> To Whom It May Concern,  
>
> My name is Jan Camenzind Broomby, I work for Swissinfo, the international department of the Swiss National Broadcasting Organisation.  
>
> I am currently working on putting together a brief videofor our social media that showcases how the Swiss Abroad celebrate the Swiss National Day (August 1st). As part of this, it would be great if you or some of the members of your Swiss organisation could send me a brief selfie video of themselves answering the following questions. 
>
> * What is your name? 
> * What country are you currently living in? 
> * What are your plans for the 1st of August? 
>
> These videos should be filmed *vertically*, and ideally with good lighting (i.e., a clear view of the individual’s face). We are working on a time constraint, and it would therefore be great to have these clips as soon as possible. The clips can either be sent to me directly via email, or through [wetransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com/)
