On Wednesday, April 24, we held the Annual General Meeting for 2023 at a new
location, Parkview Manor. 65 members were present, as well as a few guests of
honour: Ambassador Olaf Kjelsen, Consul General Line Leon-Pernet, and Honorary
Consul Alexandra Soriano.

We'll publish the provisional minutes soon, but until then, these were the most
important items:

- We got a few new [board members][board], in alphabetical order:
  - Gabriel Hilty joined as Director of Social Media and Tell Tale Designer
  - Corinne Jakob joined as Director of Entertainment
  - Alexia Moser joined as Secretary
- Cedric Daros stepped down as the head of the [Amicale Romande][amicale], and
  is succeeded by Nicholas Meyer
- We announced that we have to tighten our figurative belts, financially
- We're looking into becoming a registered charity, and have to overhaul our
  by-laws substantially in any case

Stay tuned for more details in upcoming email newsletter and [Tell
Tales][telltale]!
