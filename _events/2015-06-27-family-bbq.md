We will supply (sell) sausages with buns, potato salad and condiments, as well
as coffee.

Please *bring your own drinks* of any kind. There are usually various donated
desserts available, thanks in advance to the many donors. *If possible, bring
your own lawn chairs*, and since we expect nice weather, donâ€™t forget your
sunscreen!

### How to get there

Go west on Hwy 401 to Hwy 25 and go south to Steeles Ave., turn right (west)
for 4.3 km, to 5244 Steeles Ave., where you will see a large pond on the left
(south) side of the road with white swans (if they are not hiding). We will try
to place a Swiss flag at the entrance to the farm.
