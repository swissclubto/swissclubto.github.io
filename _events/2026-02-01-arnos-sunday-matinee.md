We will have a private viewing of the [2007 film *The Alps*][imdb] about the
climbing of the north face of the Eiger in the Bernese Alps by John Harlin III,
son of John Harlin who died on the same ascent 40 years earlier.

Doors open at 12:00 p.m.

Snacks, coffee, and drinks are available; you are welcome to bring baked goods.

The Fairview Library is located behind the Fairview Mall. You can reach it by
TTC at the end of line 4 (Don Mills Station); there is also plenty of free
parking around the library.
