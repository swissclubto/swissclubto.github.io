About the film:

> David is a happy young father. He has a wife he loves, two adorable young
> children, and a tight-knit tribe of friends he and his family always go away
> on holiday with. However, on returning from their last trip away in the
> Vosges, David is taken in for questioning by the police as part of a murder
> investigation. Before long the investigation reveals that all is not what it
> seems behind the happy and respectable facade of David’s life. Even if Noël,
> his best friend, and Marco, his lawyer, stand by him come what may, in his
> entourage doubt begins to spread and clans begin to form.

The film will be shown in French with English subtitles.
