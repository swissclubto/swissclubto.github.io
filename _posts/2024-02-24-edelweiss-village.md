You may have heard of the [Swiss Edelweiss Village][sev] in Golden, BC before:
the historic home of the pioneering Swiss mountain guides in the Rocky
Mountains was up for sale, and there were concerns about preserving its rich
history. We have mentioned it in our email newsletter a while back as well.

The new owners and the Swiss Edelweiss Village Foundation have published a
[joint statement][js], which reads like history *will* be preserved. There was
also an [article on Swissinfo][swissinfo][^1] about the village, among other media
coverage.

[^1]: The English version of the article seems to have a few image links
      broken; switch to another language, e.g., [German][side] to see them.
