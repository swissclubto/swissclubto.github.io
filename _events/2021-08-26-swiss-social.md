Hi everyone!

We are excited to announce that we will be having our August Swiss Social live!

After a year and a half of virtual events, we are finally going back to the
Duke Of York.

As this event will be happening in a pub, make sure to [RSVP].
:slightly_smiling_face:

P.S. The event will be held outside, on the patio.
