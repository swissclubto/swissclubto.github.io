Antoine, one of our representatives in the Council of the Swiss Abroad, put
together this report from the March meeting.

---

The spring meeting of the [Council of the Swiss (CSA)][csa] abroad took place
in Bern on March 15, 2024. The day prior to the meeting, the delegates met with
members of the Federal parliament at the Parliament Building in Bern.

Present from Canada were Antoine Belaieff (delegate from Ontario) and Thomas
Arn (delegate from British Columbia). Philippe Magnenat (Delegate from Québec)
joined the meeting online.

It was a pleasure for the participants to meet fellow delegates from all over
the world in person, as well as members of the Swiss Parliament, the Department
of Foreign Affairs and the OSA partner organisations such as banks and
educationsuisse.

Issues presented and discussed during the two days were:

- **E-voting** in SG, BS & TG was successful so far. GR will join and more
  cantons have confirmed interest. A working group dedicated to
  establish/maintain good contacts with the cantonal governments has received
  positive and encouraging feedback.

- Importance of **E-Government / E-ID**, as in many countries the problem also
  lies in receiving the voting documents in time. As a great step forward, the
  National Council just approved the proposed E-ID bill, with hopes high that
  E-ID is introduced in 2026. [Read more][eid]

- Ensuring the continuation of the **free movement of persons within EU**. The
  official negotiations on the future relationship between Bern and Brussels
  have begun. [Read more][persons]

- **Removing obstacles in the area of social insurance**, an example being
  finding a solution for health insurance when adequate insurance is not
  available. The parliamentary proposal [Postulat Schneider-Schneiter][socins]
  will be discussed in the National Council.

- The importance of maintaining a **consular network** despite the pressure to
  cut costs---the Organisation of the Swiss Abroad welcomed the decision of the
  Department of Foreign Affairs to not close any representations in 2023. Still,
  the **Department of Foreign Affairs** must save CHF 40 million in 2025, so
  there may be changes within some representations, with staff numbers and duties
  being adjusted. David Grichting, Director of the Consular Division, mentioned
  the updated **country specific information** for those moving abroad, available
  on the [FDFA's website][fdfa] ([information on Canada][fdfaca]). Since
  Ambassador Grichting was about to leave on a trip to Ottawa and Montréal,
  Antoine specifically asked him to ensure that the mobile passport office would
  visit Ontario this year.

- **The incoming Consul General in Montréal, Anne-Béatrice Bullinger**.
  Anne-Béatrice and Antoine went to primary school together for several years.
  She worked in Canada earlier in her career and is very excited about her
  upcoming posting. She looks forward to visiting Ontario and meeting with our
  community.

- **The importance of independent and high-quality information** for the Swiss
  abroad. The Organisation of the Swiss Abroad's position is to protect funding
  for SRG/Swissinfo. More information: [media release OSA][mediaosa]

- Given the big success of the **webinars offered to Swiss Abroad in 2023**,
  more webinars on topics relevant to the Swiss Abroad will be offered in 2024.
  The focus this year will be on Swiss Abroad returning temporarily or for good
  to Switzerland. See [dates and more information on the upcoming
  webinars][webinars], here and for the recorded previous webinars (e.g., on
  Military Service) scroll further down on the page of the link provided.

- More **democratic elections of the delegates** of the Council of the Swiss
  Abroad in the different countries. A working group has set itself the task of
  proposing and promoting a standardised process for democratic elections.
  Australia, the UK and Mexico were some of the role models for the wider
  implementation of direct elections, as it has moved from a system of election
  by the clubs to voting rights for all registered Swiss in 2017. Antoine is an
  active member of the working group.

- **Increasing the political participation of Swiss Abroad**. This is the aim
  of a working group established last year. The group is collaborating with
  other stakeholders who are also committed to increasing political participation
  and investigating ways to improve the current situation. Initiators of this
  work were Carmen Trochsler, member of the committee, and Antoine. Antoine
  remains an active member of the working group chaired by National Council
  member Laurent Wehrli (PLR, VD).

- A Working group **“Lobbying/Communication”** is complementing the work of the
  parliamentary Group Swiss Abroad (consisting of members of the Federal Swiss
  Parliament) on a cantonal level. The aim is to make interests and expectations
  of the Swiss abroad better known at the cantonal level and establish and
  maintain working relationships. Antoine is a passive member of the group.

- Review of the **legal framework and the legal structure** of the Organisation
  of the Swiss Abroad. The goal is to clarify and simplify the set of
  regulations and to ensure that the legal structure allows OSA to carry out its
  tasks effectively and respond flexibly to changed needs and environments.
  Antoine is in close contact with Carmen Trochsler, a member of this working
  group.
