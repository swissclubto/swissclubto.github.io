### Synopsis

> In Switzerland, a land of consensus and neutrality, unprecedented voices are
> being raised by women who are fighting for the recognition of structural
> racism, deconstructing stereotypes and claiming their dual Swiss and black
> identity. In this context, Rachel (Barbezat) M'Bon, a Swiss--Congolese
> journalist, begins her own quest for identity. On her way to emancipation,
> she questions her past, her present and holds up a mirror to her country and
> her peers.
