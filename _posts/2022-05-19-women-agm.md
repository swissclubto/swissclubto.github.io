The annual general meeting took place at the St. George's Golf and Country Club
on May 19.

There were no elections, and generally not all that much to discuss.

Paula Rico, head of the women's section, says she's lucky to report that all
board members have volunteered to stay on. They have been together for 14
years, and will carry on:

- Paula Rico (chair)
- Heidi Attenborough (co-chair)
- Susan Doerig (treasurer)
- Ursula Frei (secretary)

The Kaffeeklatsch get-togethers will continue, at the end of each month on the
Eastside, and on the first Wednesday each month on the Westside.

Paula will try and get a few people together to attend the [Egger farm
BBQ][bbq].
