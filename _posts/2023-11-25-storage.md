    title: The shiny new unit getting put to use

Last weekend, a group of volunteers (big thank you to Auggie, Cedric, Fredy,
and Hugo!) helped move the contents of our storage locker to a bigger unit.
Twice as large, to be precise. This is going to save us a ton of time every
time we need something from there: the old unit was so full that it basically
had to be emptied before it was possible to retrieve anything.

With the new unit, it'll be a matter of grab and go!
