title: Newsletter sign-up
permalink: /membership/newsletter/

You're interested in the Swiss Club, but you're not quite sure if it's for you?
The newsletter is a great way to get an idea of what's going on, and what kind
of events you could join. You can always upgrade to a full membership later.

We send emails a little less often than monthly, you can always unsubscribe via
a link in the email, and we'll never pass your data on to third parties.

Did you mean to sign up for a full membership? Follow these links:

- [Individual membership]({% link _pages/membership/individual.md %})
- [Family membership]({% link _pages/membership/family.md %})
