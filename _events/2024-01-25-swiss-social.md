To change things up, the first Swiss Social of 2024 is not actually "our" pub
night, but hosted by our friends of the Swiss Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
They organize a networking night for European Chambers of Commerce in Toronto,
and were friendly enough to extend the price for members also to us, the Swiss
Club.

If you're interested to join, please register on [their website]. The event
takes place in the {{ page.location }}, and features the Belgian, British,
Finnish, Dutch, and Irish chambers. The event price includes a drink and a
raffle ticket.
