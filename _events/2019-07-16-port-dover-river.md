Located on Ontarioâ€™s "south coast", the pretty lakeside town of Port Dover on
Lake Erie is our destination on this pleasant summer day.

Start off with a one hour leisurely cruise on the *River Rider* pontoon boat
(12.00 pm -- 1.00 pm), cruising up Lynn Valley River and into the Black Creek
Nature Reserve, viewing beautiful homes and gardens en route.

Following the cruise, enjoy a luncheon at the popular Erie Beach Hotel (1.15 pm
-- 2.45 pm), a Port Dover landmark since 1947 (Fresh Lake Erie pickerel and
fries, or grilled chicken and fries, assorted salads, their trademark celery
bread, plus sherbet and tea/coffee).

After lunch, you'll have time (2.45 pm -- 4.30 pm) to explore the town, stroll
the beach and soak up the sun, or browse the shops, enjoy! En route home, we'll
stop at the popular Hewitt's Dairy in Hagersville (5.00 pm -- 5.30 pm), where
you can purchase a great ice cream, if you wish.
