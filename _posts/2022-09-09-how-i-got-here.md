We got a casting inquiry for a show looking to accompany North-American born
Gen Zs who explore their (in our case, Swiss) origins:

> Hi Swiss Club Toronto,
>
> I hope that your week is going well. My name is Antony Gafarov and I am a
> Casting Associate with Forté Entertainment.
>
> I’m reaching out to let you know that we are currently casting the second
> season of _**HOW I GOT HERE**_. I think that this opportunity will be of
> interest to the 15-25yr olds in your organization---and their parents!
>
> _**HOW I GOT HERE**_ is a brand new TV series, where North-American-born Gen
> Z’s embark on an adventure of a lifetime as they travel with their immigrant
> parent back to their country of origin. They immerse themselves in special
> customs, local activities and reunite with important people from their parent’s
> past. Season One premieres this October.
>
> This is an incredible opportunity to gain new understanding on an
> all-expenses-paid, once in a lifetime trip. Our goal is to celebrate each
> participating parent and child and their unique heritage.
>
> I've attached a casting flyer that is easy to circulate and post. You can
> also check out our casting website at <https://www.fortecasting.com/>. You’ll
> find more information, the application, FAQs and video testimonials from
> those who joined us in season one.
>
> Feel free to call or email. I’m more than happy to chat with anyone from your
> team and answer questions.
