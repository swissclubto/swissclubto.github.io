Not yet a member? The Swiss community in Toronto is small but mighty, and we
are happy to have you join!

We are always looking for new members, and welcome all those interested in
taking on roles on the board, or volunteering for our various events throughout
the year, no citizenship required![^1] :slightly_smiling_face:

The cost of membership is \$30 per year for an individual or \$40 per year for
a family (two partners and children). Membership is annual from the date you
join, and can be renewed every year. Click below to sign up.

Joining the Swiss Club provides access to:

- Free entry to the Annual Swiss National Day Celebration every year
- Notifications of events throughout the year
- The quarterly Swiss Club Toronto Newsletter, *Tell Tale*
- The Annual General Meeting with voting privileges, to help shape the future
  of the Swiss Club Toronto (includes *free* dinner)
- Member discounts for various events throughout the year, including raclette
  and fondue dinners (to name a few!)

[^1]:
    Well, technically, if you dig into our bylaws, there's a rule that the
    "non-Swiss membership does not exceed at any time 20% of the total voting
    membership".

## I'm not quite sure yet :thinking:

Don't know if the Swiss Club is for you? How about signing up for our mailing
list to get a better idea of what the club is about? You can always upgrade to
a full membership later.
