As a member of the Swiss Canadian Chamber of Commerce or guest, here is an
opportunity to purchase tickets to an exceptional evening that includes a movie
screening, engaging discussion with Swiss Canadian mountaineer Sophie
Lavaud---flying over from Switzerland for this event only---and a reception
with hors d’oeuvres and drinks. Plus, each guest will leave the evening with a
special gift.

*On va Marcher sur l’Everest (Everest, Summit of Desire)*  
2014 | 52 min | Feature narrative in French | English subtitles

The movie takes on an emotional and challenging topic---it reveals what
climbing the world’s highest mountain is really like and shows how modern
expeditions give amateur mountaineers the chance to realize their desire of
Everest. The film includes outstanding footage of an ascent of the Tibetan
route to Everest.

Sophie Lavaud is one of only a dozen women worldwide who climbed 2 peaks of
over 8000m in one season.

As a professional conference speaker, she uses her success stories and the
challenges of climbing some of the highest peaks in the world to illustrate
important fundamental lessons learned for overcoming obstacles.
