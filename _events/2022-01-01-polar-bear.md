Hi everyone! The Swiss Club is participating in a Polar Bear Dip in Lake
Ontario to raise money for the association, BOOST.

So, if you feel brave enough and want to make the dip your first resolution of
2022, or just feel like supporting our dippers, grab a hot chocolate and join
us on January 1st at 11.30 am!

Don't hesitate to post on our Facebook group for more information about the
dip, location, or the association.
