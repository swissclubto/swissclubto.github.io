On *Saturday, June 25th, starting at 1 pm*, we will have our annual BBQ at the
Egger Dairy Farm in Milton, back after a 2 year Covid break.

This Men’s Section event is *open to all Swiss Club Members and their friends*.

Note: In case of rain we will be indoors in the large Barn, so come in any
weather.

We will supply (sell) sausages with buns, potato salad and condiments,
including coffee. *Please bring your own drinks of any kind.* There are usually
various donated desserts available, thanks in advance to the many donors. If
possible, bring your own lawn chairs and since we expect nice weather, don’t
forget your sunscreen!

How to get there: go west on Hwy 401 to Hwy 25 and go south to Steeles Ave.,
turn right (west) for 4.3 km, to 5244 Steeles Ave., where you will see a large
pond on the left (south) side of the road with white swans (if they are not
hiding). We will try to place a Swiss flag at the entrance to the farm.

See you all there!
