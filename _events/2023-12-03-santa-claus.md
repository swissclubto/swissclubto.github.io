with a few rules:

- The guest list (full names) must be known 48 hours before the event; **make
  sure to fill in the [RSVP form][rsvp] ahead of time, or security won't let
  you in**
- Pets aren't allowed; sorry, puppies!

Join us for an afternoon of family fun, including:

- an appearance by Santa! :santa:
- gift bags for children :shopping:
- a photo booth :camera_flash:

The building is a ten minutes walk from Sherbourne and Wellesley subway
stations; there's also on-street parking nearby, and a Green P lot at {%
