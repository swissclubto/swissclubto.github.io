In its [March newsletter][nl], the Swiss Consulate in Montreal has announced
that they'll visit Toronto with a mobile biometrics station:

> We are pleased to announce that a **mobile biometrics station** will be deployed
> in **Toronto this autumn** (exact location and dates to be confirmed). This
> initiative will simplify administrative procedures for our compatriots in the
> region, thus allowing them to complete biometric registration without
> travelling to MontrÃ©al.
>
> Further details will be shared via email with Swiss citizens in the Greater
> Toronto Area and through the [SwissInTouch] app.
