Hi everyone!

We are excited to announce that the holidays will be coming a little earlier
for the Swiss Club, as our November Swiss Social will be the Christmas
edition---so dig up your favourite holiday sweater and come enjoy a few
Christmas drinks with us at the Duke of York!

PS: The event will be held inside so make sure to bring your proof of
vaccination + ID.
