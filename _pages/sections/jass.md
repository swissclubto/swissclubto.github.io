Do you like to play Jass, then this is for you!

We no longer look for a champion and you do not have to be a pro, we will
strictly play a

1. **social**, **friendly**, and **relaxed** game
2. We play the **Schieber** (no Wys) as we always did
3. Cost: $2 (for miscellaneous expenses)

**Location:** Agincourt room at {% include maps.html addr="3131 Bridletowne
Circle, Toronto" description="3131 Bridletowne Circle, Toronto" %} (near Finch
and Warden); free parking at the back of the building.

**Time:** 1 pm to approximately 5 pm

{% include upcoming-events.html term="jass" %}

Free coffee and tea will be available. No other drinks will be available, so if
you like, you can bring your own.

The Swiss Club Toronto is continuing to pay the rent for the location. With
this, I encourage you to become a member of the club. So, come on out and bring
a friend who likes to play also.

I am always open to receiving suggestions and comments.

:information_source: To be able to have complete tables, it would really be
appreciated if you would contact me prior to the date. This way, no one will be
left out to play.
