The bowling section has been part of the Swiss Club since the very beginning in
1918!

## Monthly bowling

Feeling like doing something fun during the cold winter months? Join us once a
month on Sundays at 3 pm at the {% include maps.html addr="Parkway Bowl,
Scarborough" description="Parkway Bowling Alley" %} for three games and
optional dinner afterwards at a nearby restaurant.

The price for bowling is \$25, plus shoe rental.

We play on the following dates:

| January 15, 2023            |
| Febuary 5, 2023 (new date!) |
| March 12, 2023              |
| April 16, 2023              |

We are a family friendly group, our youngest player is six, and there is no age
limit.
