Join the [Jass section][jass] for a social, friendly, and relaxed game of
Schieber (no Wys).

Free coffee and tea are provided; you can bring your own drink if you prefer
something else.

:information_source: To be able to have complete tables, it would really be
appreciated if you would contact me prior to the date. This way, no one will be
left out to play.
{: .notice--info}

The Swiss Club Toronto is paying the rent for the location, so we encourage
attendees to [become members][join] after a while.
