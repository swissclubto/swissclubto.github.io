Join the [Social Jass section][jass] for a friendly and relaxed game of
Schieber (no Wys; see the section page for detailed rules).

Free coffee and tea are provided; you can bring your own drink if you prefer
something else.

:information_source: To be able to have complete tables, it would really be
appreciated if you would contact me no later than one day before the date. This
way, no one will be left out to play.

The Swiss Club Toronto is paying the rent for the location, so we encourage
attendees to [become members][join] after a while.
