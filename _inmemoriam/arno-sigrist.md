From the [obituary]:

> Arno never forgot his Swiss heritage. He was an integral member of the Swiss
> Club Toronto volunteering as President of the Men’s Section and Canadysli
> Band. This earned him awards from the Swiss community including Swiss Citizen
> of the Year and Longest Personal Member of the Swiss Canadian Chamber of
> Commerce.
>
> Arno always wanted to play the drum, but it was only when he joined Canadysli
> in Toronto that he learned. He looked forward to each practice, and annual
> Morgestraich, Fasnacht Ball and First of August Celebration with bandmates
> and fans. Arno could always be seen with a big smile playing his Drummle and
> selling Fasnacht buttons. Arno organized tours and events for the Men’s
> Section and kept the signature weekly Kaffi Klatsch (social gathering for
> coffee and conversation) running even through COVID.
