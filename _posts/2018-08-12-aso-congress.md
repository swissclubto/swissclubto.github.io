Dear Members of the Swiss Club Toronto,

As your Delegate for Ontario and Central Canada, I participated in the
96<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Swiss Abroad that took place in Visp, from
August 10 to 12, 2018. This was a great occasion for meeting with the other
Delegates from Canada, who all attended the Congress, and with participants
from all over the world.

Many points were discussed, and a detailed summary of the session can be read
on the ASO website (<https://www.aso.ch>). In particular, I would like to call
the attention of the readers of Tell Tale and of the Members of the Swiss Club
Toronto to the launch of the following online petition calling on the Federal
Council and parliament to make electronic voting accessible to all Swiss abroad
by 2021.

Most of the Swiss living in Canada do not encounter major difficulties with the
system of postal vote. However, in other parts of the world, some of our fellow
citizens receive their voting documents too late (or never receive it at all),
which makes it difficult for them to exercise their political rights as Swiss
citizens. Therefore, I would like to encourage you to sign online this petition
in support of e-voting (see below). Many thanks for your support!

Florence Pasche Guignard, OSA Delegate for Ontario and Central Canada

> 30 November 2018.

> Further information on the petition’s starting point, justification and aim
