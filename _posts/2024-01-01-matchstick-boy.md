We were recently made aware of a newly published novel about the match industry
in Switzerland's Frutigland around 1850: *The Matchstick Boy* by Rowena Kinread
([Goodreads], [Amazon]).

The story includes history of the Jungen family, descendants of which made us
aware of the book. So, if you feel like reading up on some Swiss history, this
looks like a good opportunity!
