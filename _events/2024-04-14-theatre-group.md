Dear Members of the Swiss Club,

we will have our Swiss German play again at the Latvian Centre on Sunday, April
14, at 2 pm.

If you plan on attending our event, please make your reservation by email or
phone to Walter.

We especially like to know if you are planning to have Lunch there so we can
plan accordingly.

Many thanks!

Walter Brunner and Maggie Hess
