### Synopsis

> Avril, an independently minded lawyer known for taking on lost causes,
> resolves to secure a victory in her next case. However, when Dariuch, another
> seemingly hopeless client, asks her to defend his faithful canine companion,
> Cosmos, Avril is unable to resist. She dives into the absurdity of defending
> a canine client, confronting not only the legal system but also advocating
> for both women's and animal rights. A lively and at times comical court case
> unfolds---where a dog's life hangs in the balance.
