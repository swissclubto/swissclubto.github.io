## 5. President's Report

Nadia mentioned that there were several changes over the year, but all are good
changes and will help the Club grow.

Before the Report, Nadia asked everyone to rise and observe a minute of silence
to remember the members who passed away in the past year. May the rest in
peace.

Nadia said that the last year has been a great year for the Swiss Club. There
was a rise in Memberships and all events had good attendance numbers. Although
the Club and its members are growing older, we have some new and younger
members, which means the club will continue as a support for the Swiss Canadian
community in Toronto.

There were several changes on the board over the last year, so Nadia gave an
update on the Sections first.

### Social Jass (former: Jass section)

After 33 years in the position, Albert Lanz retired and Erika Tieche, a
longtime member and former President, took the Section on. A big thank you to
Albert for his commitment, effort and time he had put into the Jass Section.
She wished him a happy retirement and hopes we will continue to see him at
different Club events.

A warm welcome to Erika back on the board. and to move forward with the
Section, now as Social Jass.

### Amicale Romande

This year, the Amicale Romande held their annual Raclette event with over 40
attendees and a great turnout.

Jean-Marc, the Section Head of the Amicale Romande, also retired after over 40
years.

A big thank you to Jean-Marc for his commitment and time towards the Club.
Nadia also thanked all the volunteers, including Molly English (treasurer and
bookkeeper and loyal supporter, Freddy and Norma Wenger and their family,
Francois Balet and his extended family, Didier Artus, Hugo Baumann, Marie
Therese and family, Suzanne Bielman and countless other Swiss friends from
different sections.

She thanked them all for feeding everyone so much cheese, bread and potatoes as
well as drinks and desserts too.

Noemie Steiner took on the Amicale Romande briefly as the Section head and she
did organize the Raclette, but now we are back to looking for someone that
would love to fill the position so we can continue to have our Raclette and
Fondue events.

### Gym Section

Nadia announced that the **Gym section**, after talking to the section and
Section head Suzi Hubler, had retired. The Gym section had their annual canoe
trip, but hadn't had much going on otherwise. Sport related events will now be
held through the club itself and/or as part of the Swiss Social section.

Nadia thanked Suzi Hubler for taking on the Gym section after Werner Flury
retired from his role.

### Canadysli

The Swiss Club welcomed the **Canadysli** as a new section.  Conversations
started in late 2022 and now they are officially part of our Club with Philippe
Moser as Section head.

The Canadysli is a carnival marching band that plays music in the style of the
Swiss carnival bands of Luzern and Basel, known as Guggemusig.  They started as
a Club in 1978 and now Nadia is happy to welcome Philippe and all his members
in the Swiss Club.

### Theatre Group

Over 30 years Maggie Hess is the Section head of the **Theatre Group**.  After
the forced Covid break, the Theatre Group is putting on a play this spring
2023.
