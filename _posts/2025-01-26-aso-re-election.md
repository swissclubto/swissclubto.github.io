The Council of the Swiss Abroad (CSA)[^1] re-elects its delegates for the
2025--2029 mandate between January and June 2025.

[^1]: The CSA is the supreme body of the Organization of the Swiss Abroad
    (OSA).

Detailed information is available in [German] or [French]. A few relevant
points for members of the Swiss Club Toronto:

- Canada is divided into three electoral constituencies with two
  delegates each: West, Ontario, and East.
- The Ontario delegates for the 2021--2025 mandate were Suzanne Sch√ºrmann and
  Antoine Belaieff.
- We posted some updates from the CSA from time to time:
  - 2024: [Council of the Swiss Abroad meets in Berne][berne]
  - 2023: [Report from the spring meeting of the Council of the Swiss
    Abroad][spring]
  - 2022: [November 2022 CSA meeting][nov]
  - 2022: [Report from the 2022 ASO Congress in Lugano][lugano]
- Canada is one of 13 countries selected for direct and centralized elections
  by way of an online system. In the past, the Swiss Club Toronto was tasked
  with organizing the elections, and it was never quite satisfactory.
- Antoine is part of the working group that guides the introduction of the
  direct elections.

  election website ([German version][elecger], [French version][elecfr])
