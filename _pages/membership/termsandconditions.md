## Refund policy

If you are not satisfied with your membership purchase, please contact us by
email at {% include email.html addr="membership@swissclubtoronto.ca" %}. You
may request a refund within 30 days of the receipt of your payment. Event
registrations are non-refundable. Refunds are done via cheque.

## Information collection, use, and sharing

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have
access to collect information that you voluntarily give us via web form, email,
or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to
anyone. Membership information is stored in a third-party system called
[Membee] (see their [privacy policy][mpp]).

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside
of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g., to
renew your membership.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell
you about events, opportunities, or changes to this privacy policy. We use a
third-party system called [Mailchimp] for that (see the [privacy policy of
their parent company, Intuit][mcpp]).

Transactional email (updates to your membership, invoices, etc.) is sent from
Membee directly, and you cannot unsubscribe from these emails.

We collect anonymized site usage statistics using a tool called [GoatCounter].
It was [created as a privacy-friendly alternative to tools such as Google
Analytics or Matomo][gcwhy]; see their [privacy policy][gcpp].

## Your access to and control over information

You may opt out of any future contact from us at any time, except from
transactional email as long as you're a member. You can do the following at any
time by contacting us via {% include email.html
addr="membership@swissclubtoronto.ca" %}:

- See what data we have about you, if any
- Change/correct any data we have about you (also possible self-serve via the
  [profile page][pp])
- Have us delete any data we have about you
- Express any concern you have about our use of your data

## Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
information via the website, your information is protected both online and
offline.

Most of this website is served as static pages. Where it's possible to interact
with the website, for example to update your user profile, or to fill in a
form, traffic is encrypted using HTTPS.

We do not store any sensitive information such as credit card data. When you
use a credit card to pay your membership fee, or store your credit card data
for automatic renewal, that data is sent encrypted to Membee (see above) and
processed by a payment provider called [Worldline] (formerly Bambora; see their
[privacy policy][wlpp]).

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we
also protect your information offline. Only club administrators who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or membership
administration) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
