Are you a **Swiss Club member** who hasn't come out to an event in a while?

Were you a **past or present volunteer** at one of Swiss Club Toronto's events?

Are you **interested in our events** but haven't come out to one yet?

**We'd like to welcome you all to our 2023 Christmas Social!**

We couldn't do this without you. To show our appreciation, we will have drinks
