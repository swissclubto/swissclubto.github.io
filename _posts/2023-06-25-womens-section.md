The Women's Section held their AGM on May 25th at Jolly's Italian restaurant.
After a nice lunch, we discussed a few items, and of course tried to get
volunteers for our positions on the board. All of us served several terms, and
we are up for election, but nobody came forward---that means all of us are
carrying on for another term:

*[AGM]: Annual General Meeting

| Name               | Position   |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Paula Rico         | Chair      |
| Heidi Attenborough | Vice Chair |
| Susan Doerig       | Treasurer  |
| Ursula Frei        | Secretary  |

On June 6th, our [westside kaffeeklatsch][kk] was on the patio for the first
time this year, which of course we enjoyed.

On June 10th, many of the section attended the celebration of life for Heidi's
husband Gerry.

On June 24th, some of us met at the [Egger farms BBQ][bbq] organized by the
Men's Section.

On August 12th, another trip is available, to the Peach Festival in Niagara.
The price is \$99, lunch included. Because of high demand, reservations should
be made ASAP, one bus is already full! See the [event page] for details.
