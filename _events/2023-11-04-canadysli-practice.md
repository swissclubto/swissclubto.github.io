It's that time of year when we begin our merriment of noise making in
preparation of another season of Guggemusig.  

We will have our first practice at {{ page.start_time }} on {{ page.date |
date: "%B %-dth, %Y" }}. We will continue to practise at Record Tech located at
{{ page.address }}. For those who have not been there: drive to the back of the
warehouse and enter via the back door, park anywhere you find space. If you
need a ride, please reach out to me.

Practices will continue on Saturdays, but will add some Sunday practices as the
season moves along to allow a few additional members to join us. The first
Sunday practice will be on December 10th. That week we will not practise on
the Saturday.
