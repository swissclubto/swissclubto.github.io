No changes needed towards the 2022 AGM minutes.

Motion: Arno Sigrist moved that the minutes of the 2022 AGM be accepted.\
Michele Zanocello seconded.

## 4. Swiss Citizen of the Year Award

As every year, Rene Waelti---a long time contributor, former president and
Alphorn player, made sure that ballots for nominations for this year's Swiss
Citizen of the Year Award were on the tables. The Votes are collected at the
AGM, the award will be announced and given out at the Swiss National Day event.

## 5. President's Report

Nadia mentioned that there were several changes over the year, but all are good
changes and will help the Club grow.

Before the Report, Nadia asked everyone to rise and observe a minute of silence
to remember the members who passed away in the past year. May the rest in
peace.

Nadia said that the last year has been a great year for the Swiss Club. There
was a rise in Memberships and all events had good attendance numbers. Although
the Club and its members are growing older, we have some new and younger
members, which means the club will continue as a support for the Swiss Canadian
community in Toronto.

There were several changes on the board over the last year, so Nadia gave an
update on the Sections first.

### Social Jass (former: Jass section)

After 33 years in the position, Albert Lenz retired and Erika Tieche, a
longtime member and former President, took the Section on. A big thank you to
Albert for his commitment, effort and time he had put into the Jass Section.
She wished him a happy retirement and hopes we will continue to see him at
different Club events.

A warm welcome to Erika back on the board. and to move forward with the
Section, now as Social Jass.

### Amicale Romande

This year, the Amicale Romande held their annual Raclette event with over 40
attendees and a great turnout.

Jean-Marc, the Section Head of the Amicale Romande, also retired after over 40
years.

A big thank you to Jean-Marc for his commitment and time towards the Club.
Nadia also thanked all the volunteers, including Molly English (treasurer and
bookkeeper and loyal supporter, Freddy and Norma Wenger and their family,
Francois Balet and his extended family, Didier Artus, Hugo Baumann, Marie
Therese and family, Suzanne Bielman and countless other Swiss friends from
different sections.

She thanked them all for feeding everyone so much cheese, bread and potatoes as
well as drinks and desserts too.

Noemie Steiner took on the Amicale Romande briefly as the Section head and she
did organize the Raclette, but now we are back to looking for someone that
would love to fill the position so we can continue to have our Raclette and
Fondue events.

### Gym Section

Nadia announced that the Gym section, after talking to the section and Section
head Suzi Hubler, had retired. The Gym section had their annual canoe trip, but
hadn't had much going on otherwise. Sport related events will now be held
through the club itself and/or as part of the Swiss Social section.

Nadia thanked Suzi Hubler for taking on the Gym section after Werner Flury
retired from his role.

### Canadysli

The Swiss Club welcomed the Canadysli as a new section.  Conversations started
in late 2022 and now they are officially part of our Club with Philippe Moser
as Section head.

The Canadysli is a carnival marching band that plays music in the style of the
Swiss carnival bands of Luzern and Basel, known as Guggemusig.  They started as
a Club in 1978 and now Nadia is happy to welcome Philippe and all his members
in the Swiss Club.

### Theatre Group

Maggie Hess is the Section head of the Theatre Group for over 30 years. After
the forced Covid break, the Theatre Group is putting on a play this spring
2023\. They found a suitable comedy for the group and they practiced weekly
over several months. Their first performance is going to take place this
weekend, on Sunday April 16 in Wellesley. The Toronto performance will be next
Weekend, on April 22 at the Latvian Center. Hopefully many of you will be able
to be there.

### Men's Section

Next, Nadia mentioned the Men's Section. Led by the ever energetic Arno Sigrist
for over 30 years, the section is going strong with weekly Kaffeeklatsches
every Monday morning and regular virtual meetings, too. The men's section had
quite a few events in 2022, including a lunch and their AGM, the June BBQ at
the Egger Dairy Farm, a Swiss Movie Matinee in October and their Christmas
Lunch at the St. George's Golf and Country Club in November.  Sadly, they have
lost a few avid contributors and loyal members in 2022, including Trudi Egger,
Werner Flury and Albert Huwiler---may the rest in peace.

### Women's Section

The Women's Section, led by the indefatigable Paula Rico, who unfortunately
could not be here today, continues to have their Kaffeeklatsches twice a week.

Last month, they were at the Village players to see a performance; they will
make another visit on May 7th. Upcoming is their AGM on May 25th at Jolly's
Italian restaurant with a free lunch.

Nadia wanted to recognize Paula for all of the years she has been leading the
Women's Section, for her leadership, energy and dedication to the Swiss
community and the Women's Section members.

### 5-Pin Bowling

Further the 5-pin Bowling, led by Simone Hohn, was mentioned. They are a small
but fun group of bowlers that meet once a month from September to April.
Playing 3 games and normally having dinner close by afterwards. The next set
date is April 23rd, everyone is welcome to join them. They play for fun, but do
keep track of the scores to assign the trophies.

### Swiss Social

The final section mentioned by Nadia is led by the Vice President Charlotte
Mariller for the last 1.5 years, the Swiss Social. The socials have continued
to happen every last Thursday of the month, in person at the Duke of York pub
and some new locations the section has been testing out. 2022 also brought a
partnership with our fellow Swiss organization, the Swiss Canadian Chamber of
Commerce. They had a joint social event at a pub in October and had over 50
people attending---definitely a good reason to continue partnering where it
makes sense, so that we can continue to bring the Swiss community together in
different ways. The Swiss Social held a Christmas social at Jack Astor's with
an attendance of over 30 people. It was a great way to recognize our volunteers
and members in a fun and festive way to end the year.

### Events

The President, Nadia, mentioned some other events that happened in the past
year.

On July 24th we celebrated the Swiss National Day with over 400 people in
attendance. She hopes we will have the same great outcome this year.

Because of the timing of the games of Switzerland playing at the World Cup,
there were no in-person events organized to cheer on the Swiss team, but we
know that the members were cheering them on at home and the Club supported them
in spirit.

For Christmas 2022, a Toronto restaurant was found that served Fondue so there
was a Fondue night in December.

### Website

Nadia mentioned the presence on the web, as that is the main way to keep the
members informed and how the Club attracts new members. Benjamin Wuethrich, our
Membership Chairperson and Website Editor, created a new website. Newly, we
have an “In Memoriam” page. When the Club is informed of a member's passing,
people can request to have this added in that section. This is an option, but
it will only be posted if requested to do so by a member.

The President thanked Benjamin for all his time and effort he put into the new
Website. For capturing the history of the club, and for ensuring that all the
photos and records of the events and activities the Club does have a home for
many years to come.

She encouraged everyone that hasn't done so, to check it out at
[swissclubtoronto.ca].

## 6. Financial Statement 2021--2022

Treasurer Auggie Werner explained the financial statement of the past years.
No auditor has been used this year. It is mainly to insure the Treasurer.

Things mentioned were that most Sections do have their own finances, especially
the smaller ones and that he, as a Treasurer does not have direct access to the
money of the Swiss Club. The main event in the past year was the Swiss National
Day. Sales are mainly the donations, sale of the Nussgipfel, the Fondue event
and the Membership contributions.

Under purchases are the membership software, storage, Zoom membership, section
contributions, insurance, Tell Tale, National Day expenses, Meeting/AGM
expenses and similar.

Move to accept: Philippe Moser\
Erika Tieche seconds. All approved.

## 7. Membership Report

Benjamin informed everyone of the Member numbers of the past year. He also
mentioned that, if you are comfortable using the webpage, you can update your
profile there.

The Membership program we use, reminds Members quite often to pay their fee,
after 6 months of non-payment the Membership got cancelled. Benjamin removed
that feature and is reaching out more often to Members that haven't paid their
Membership on time.

The number of memberships as of end March 2023 are as follows:

| Single                | 108     |
| Family                | 165     |
| **Total Memberships** | **405** |

## 8. Council of the Swiss Abroad Report

Unfortunately our ASO delegates couldn't be here tonight, so Nadia was reading
the report they had prepared for us.

On March 16 and 17 the spring meeting of the Council of the Swiss Abroad took
place in Berne, preceded by an exchange between delegates and national
councillors. This year the exchange was followed by a workshop.

### Key takeaways from the general meeting and exchange with parliamentarians

- **Banks:** The OSA continues to establish new partnerships with Swiss Banks
  to serve our community. The Zuercher Kantonalbank, in addition to Post Finance,
  now serves Swiss citizen who live in Canada, but the fees are close to 500.-
  per year.
- **E-voting:** Basel-Stadt, Thurgau and St.Gallen will be testing e-voting in
  the June vote.
- **Mode of election of delegates:** Delegates are now chosen by Swiss clubs and
  associations. Associations in the UK, Mexico and Australia have tested a
  universal ballot to allow anyone registered to elect their representatives.
  What do you think? Send your input to Antoine and Suzanne.
- **Federal elections 2023:** Political parties are getting ready for the 2023
  elections. Let the parties know what matters to you and consider joining an
  international section and even put your name on a main list or sublist and run
  for office in Switzerland.
- **Driver's licence:** A new issue popped up after the meeting. The old blue
  driver's licence is not going to be valid after January 31, 2024. As it stands,
  a Swiss driver's licence cannot be renewed if you do not live in Switzerland.

### Key takeaways from the workshop on democratic participation

The return of e-voting does not guarantee that the participation of the 5th
Switzerland will immediately rise to the level of the inland Swiss.

For this reason, the OSA and delegates Carmen Trochsler from Australia and
Antoine Belaieff from Canada collaborated with the NGO *Campus for Democracy* to
organize a workshop to find the active democratic participation of the Swiss
abroad. Many good ideas came out of the workshop, particularly on better
information on the themes we vote on and why voting matters.

A second workshop is being organized to take place in June with an eye to
identify concrete steps and responsibilities, and present the plan at the ASO
congress in August.

What should be the priorities of the Council of the Swiss Abroad and the
Organisation of the Swiss Abroad? What would you like to say to the parties in
this election year? Tell Suzanne and Antoine. Send Antoine and Suzanne your
ideas, fill out the survey and let them know if you do not vote and would agree
to be interviewed.

## 9. Elections

Our President had some big announcements regarding the elections for this year,
effective as of this AGM.

Nadia Berger, the President is stepping down as a President, because she is
moving to Switzerland. She will miss the Swiss Club Toronto, the board members
and all the wonderful people she met in and through the Club.

Another Board member, the Secretary Simone Hohn, is also stepping down after 3
years. Nadia thanked her for her contribution.

With that being said, the newly arranged team could look as follows:

- President---Charlotte Mariller is willing to step up and fill the position.
- Vice President---Benjamin Wuethrich (current Membership Chairperson and
  Website editor)
- Secretary---OPEN---is responsible for the Club's records, takes minutes

Nadia invited candidates for the positions of President, Vice President and
Secretary to introduce themselves and to say a few words about themselves and
why they would like to take on that role. She asked Arno to lead the voting and
election.

Benjamin Wuethrich introduced himself and handed a gift and thank you card to
Nadia. Nadia was very grateful and thanked the board and Members and said that
it was a pleasure to work for the Club in all the different positions she had
over the past few years.

Afterwards Charlotte Mariller introduced herself. She would be excited for her
new role as President and she hopes to be able to organize many social events
to bring together all the generations.

Arno Sigrist did the election, Charlotte got voted in for President and
Benjamin for Vice President. No objections were made.
