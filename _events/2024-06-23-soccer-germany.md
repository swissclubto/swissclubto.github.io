Our friends from the German Meetup Toronto graciously agreed to have us join
their viewing of Switzerland vs. Germany, with a friendly warning:

> There will be a lot of Germans, but they'll be friendly!

The [Meetup page][meetup] points to an [Eventbrite page][eventbrite], and
tickets are free. Come be a (friendly) thorn in the side of the German fans!
