With things finally opening up, we are excited to announce that our Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be taking place again this year. We have not had an AGM since April 2019, so this meeting will review the activities of the past two years, since the pandemic began.

### Agenda

| Time    | What                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 6.30 pm | Registration and Cocktails (cash bar)                 |
| 7.00 pm | Dinner (courtesy of the Swiss Club Toronto)           |
| 8.00 pm | Call to order and start of the Annual General Meeting |

At this meeting we will also be officially electing our President, Vice-President, and Membership Chairperson as we have not had the opportunity to complete AGM activities since 2019. *All members in good standing* are invited to attend. In order to attend the AGM, you must have received at least two COVID vaccination shots. We thank you for your understanding.\
