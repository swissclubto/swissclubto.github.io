### It’s Blossom Time in Niagara

Niagara’s fruit trees come into blossom in the lovely month of May and put on
quite a show for visitors to the area. Join Time Of Your Life Tours for this
annual spring spectacle, and enjoy a day that starts off with a morning drive
to Beamsville for some **wine tastings and shopping time at Magnotta Winery**.

Next it’s on to **Betty’s Restaurant** in Chippawa / Niagara Falls for a tasty
luncheon of choice (roast beef, roast chicken, or their famous fish and chips).
We’ll have a look at the Falls before motoring up the lovely Niagara Parkway to
Niagara-on-the-Lake enjoying blossoms, spring flowers and views of the Niagara
River all the way.

There’s time for shopping and browsing in this charming town before we set our
sights for home.

Cost includes motorcoach transportation, winery visit and tastings, lunch, all
taxes and meal tip.
