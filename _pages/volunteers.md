We are looking for new volunteers to bring their skills and experience to our
small but mighty team. Here's what's in store for you:

- Meet and get to know community members
- Wear different hats to support and organize our events (likely to include
  cheese and chocolate!)
- Join a great bunch of people and enjoy a free dinner or two
- Implement your ideas for fun ways to engage members
- Keep the Swiss Club alive through your time and effort
- Make an impact on the Swiss Community
