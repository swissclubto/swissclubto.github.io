With great sadness, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation announces the passing
of our founder, Gordon Moore.

With his characteristic humility and word economy, Gordon Moore once wrote "my
career as an entrepreneur happened quite by accident." A brilliant scientist,
business leader and philanthropist, Gordon co-founded and led two pioneering
technology enterprises, Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, and, with his wife,
Betty, created one of the largest private grantmaking foundations in the U.S.,
the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
