Please come and join Denise and Sascha Frassini for a tour and picnic starting
at Wardâ€™s Island. You can bike, walk, or rollerblade at your own leisure. Bring
your own picnic. We will meet at 10:30 a.m. sharp in front of the ferry
terminal. Be there a little earlier to buy your ferry tickets. Weather
permitting.
