### Synopsis

> Following an argument with her boyfriend, thirty-eight-year old Liv SÃ ndor
> walks through Zurich, reminiscing about past loves. In all her relationships,
> there was always one turning point, where everything went downhill. As she
> wanders through parks, streets and cafes, Liv faces her fears, her moments of
> joy and her demons, before she eventually finds the means to free herself of
> them. A rollercoaster ride through the tragicomic everyday life of a dreamy,
> funny and touching heroine.
