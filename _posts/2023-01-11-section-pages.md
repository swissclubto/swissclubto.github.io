In an effort to provide more visibility into what our sections do and offer,
each one of them now has its own page under the [*Contact* tab].

They are currently in various stages of completeness, as indicated by a little
:construction: banner where appropriate.

Of special interest: the page of the [bowling section][bowling] has the dates
of the next few sessions, and the page of the [jass section][jass] has all the
information about meetups organized by the new section head, Erika Ti√®che.

Please reach out to the section heads if you have questions, or if you're
interested in joining an event!
