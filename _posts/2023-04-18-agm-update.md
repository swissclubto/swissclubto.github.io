Last Thursday, we held our annual general meeting at the Chelsea Hotel (see the
[gallery]). Here are a few highlights:

- Nadia Berger steps down as president to make a dream reality: she's moving to
  Switzerland (of all places)!
- Simone Höhn steps down from her position as secretary, but we get to keep her
  as the head of the [five-pin bowling section][5pin]
- Charlotte Mariller is moving from the vice-president to the president role,
  while staying on as the head of the Swiss Social section
- Benjamin Wuethrich moves into the role of vice-president and keeps the
  membership chairperson role (and the website)
- The [Canadysli] join as a new section with Philippe Moser as the section head

We'd like thank all the board members, past and present, for all the work they
do for the Swiss Club.

Have a look at the [contact page][contact] to see the board in its new
composition.

We also voted on changes to the by-laws, reported on the past year, and
inaugurated new lifetime members; watch this place for the meeting minutes,
coming soon.
