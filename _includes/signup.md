Please fill in the application below. For payment, there are three options in
the "Method of Payment" drop-down menu at the bottom; in decreasing order of
our preference:

1. **e-Transfer:** send an Interac e-Transfer to {% include email.html
   addr="finance@swissclubtoronto.ca" %} (fast and cheap for us)

   We have [Autodeposit] enabled, so the security question and answer don't
   matter.

2. **Credit card:** pay online (fast, but the credit card processor takes a cut)
3. **Cheque:** mail a cheque to

   {% include pobox-address.html %}

   (can take up to a month to be processed)
