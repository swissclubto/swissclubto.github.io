Are you interested in a canoe trip? And don’t worry if you have never been in a
canoe before. As in past years, the Gym Section is organizing a canoe trip to
Algonquin Park on the long weekend August 4 to 6.

We leave very early Saturday morning and rent canoes before we enter the park.
We start out on Rain Lake and have our eye set on a smaller lake. To get there,
we will paddle for 5--6 hours and carry canoes and camping gear over a couple
of portages.

Once there, we look for a nice campsite and setup camp for two nights.

On Sunday, everybody is free to enjoy, relax or explore, soak up some sun, or
soak in the water, do a little tour with the canoe, or some hiking.

Then, on Monday the real world is already calling again and we will get back to
Toronto early evening.

This is also a great event to send your visitors from abroad to let them enjoy
something different in Canada’s wilderness.

If you are interested, get in touch with {{ page.contact }}. Space is limited,
so it will be first come, first serve.
