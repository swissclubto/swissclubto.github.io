The Swiss Club Toronto presents Raclette de l'Amicale Romande, back after a one
year hiatus!

The location is new for the event, but not new for the club; many will remember
the Hansa Haus as the location of a few of our National Day celebrations.

Join us for all you can eat raclette, Swiss wine, and excellent company. You
can help us plan by registering ahead of time via the [RSVP form][rsvp], and
simplify logistics on the day of the event by paying early via e-Transfer to {%
include email.html addr="finance@swissclubtoronto.ca" %} (mention "Raclette" in
the e-Transfer message).
