As you may know, we have been looking for new and fun things to do together in
the city, with a Swiss theme. The wait is over! Our first special Swiss Social
event is happening on March 1st!

Join us downtown for a Raclette dinner at Coq of the Walk bar/restaurant, at
488 College St., just west of Bathurst!

It will be a night to fill your belly with delicious Swiss raclette cheese. {{
page.cost }} covers raclette plus charcuterie, salad, potatoes, and a table
full of Swiss folk ready to eat, drink, and be merry!

{{ page.cost }} will cover tax and tip, but you will have to pay extra for
drinks.

Seats are limited to 10, and are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

If you are interested in attending, please email me at <{{
site.data.people.nadia.email }}> and I will keep everyone posted on number of
spots left! Payment will occur via email transfer.

Thank you and hope to see you out!
